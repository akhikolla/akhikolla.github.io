I"ñ<p>As a part of (R consortium fuzz testing proposal)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15z2diPTJ3MTLe3H9WfHNAdzkn1bYIsLJ6_tpGWRqQBU/edit], we are creating a simple prototype on how to extract the valid inputs for a function from the RcppTestPackage and test it with Valgrind. We also test the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test harness</code> of the same rcpp method by passing DeepStateâ€™s randomized inputs and see if Valgrind can detect any errors for those inputs.</p>
