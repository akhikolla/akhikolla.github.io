**Limited Fuzz Testing**



### Background
	Testing a software application is always a tough job and time consuming. Inorder to successfully identify bugs in your package we need to consider the following:

1. Randomized Inputs.
2. Code Coverage
3. Learned Inputs

We should be able to pass both valid and invalid inputs to test the package. The inputs that are generated should be able to test each and every of the code efficiently. The most important thing we need to consider while testing an application is to make sure that we don't pass the same inputs again and again instead we should be able to learn from the previous inputs and try to uncover bugs if there are any.

DeepState is one such tool which supports all the three features and helps us test the packages.The inputs generated by the DeepState_* function are random and covers most part of the code. It generates tuned inputs to discover more bugs in the package. 

As a part of the RcppDeepState, We are testing the Rcpp packages with the help of deepstate testing framework. The RcppDeepState helps us find the subtle bugs in the packages .
